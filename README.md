# World_Weather_Analysis
## Choosing cities to travel to based on the Current Weather.


### Summary
Using WeatherPy.ipynb and VacationPy.ipynb to gauge the information tha would be retireved from both Open Weather Map API and Google Maps API, respectively. Then applying that to create the following with with each file:

* WeatherPy.ipynb: Generating 1500 random datapoints and collecting 626 cities from the datapoints. Then used Open Weather Map API to collect the current weather data of each city, plotting the weather parameters collected, establishing a correlation and linear regression with Latitude and Weather Parameters.
* VacationPy.ipynb: Graphing maps filtered by set temperatures inputted by the user and add markers with the nearest hotels available using Google maps Places API. 
* Vacation_Search.ipynb & Vacation_Itinerary.ipynb: These files filters the cities generated by Weather_Database.ipynb based on the input maximum and minimum preferred temperatures inputted by the user. Then generate a google map with markers for each city displaying: City, Country Code, Hotel Name, Current Weather. Also generating an itinerary or route of four cities selected by user input using Google maps Direction API.
